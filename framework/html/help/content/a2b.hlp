<p>The option “Calling Cards” of the Menu “Extras” in Issabel offers us the possibility to work with Asterisk2billing to provide telephony services to customers and also making international calls for a price that is lower than normal through a number that the telephone company provides for making calls. These companies can be the typical telephone companies of each country or businesses specializing in telephone services.</p>
<p>In Asterisk2Billing you have an administrator interface where you can create agents for the service and the ID for your customers who will receive the telephony service.</p>
